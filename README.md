Atomic Swap ERC20
This is a smart contract written in Solidity language to facilitate atomic swap of ERC20 tokens.

Description
This contract allows two parties to exchange ERC20 tokens in a trustless and decentralized way. Atomic swap ensures that either both parties successfully complete the trade or the transaction is reverted. This contract also implements a time lock mechanism to ensure timely completion of the trade.

Requirements
Ethereum wallet with support for ERC20 tokens
Solidity compiler
ERC20 token addresses and their corresponding values
Usage
Deploy the contract on the Ethereum network using the Solidity compiler.
Use the open function to initiate a swap by providing the ERC20 token addresses and values.
Wait for the other party to respond with a corresponding swap offer.
Use the close function to complete the swap and transfer tokens to the respective parties.
Use the expire function to refund the original token holder if the other party fails to complete the swap within the specified time frame.
